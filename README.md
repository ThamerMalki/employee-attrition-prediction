# Employee Attrition Prediction Model

## Introduction
This is a course project for Senior level of computer science for Neural Network course.
Employee attrition refers to the rate at which employees leave
a company. It's a significant issue for large companies because
it can lead to financial losses. Many factors can cause attrition,
like unhappiness with the job, bad management, or a lack of
chances to grow. This project focuses on understanding and
solving the company's employee attrition problem by creating
models that can predict who might leave in the future.
## Group Work
We worked in a group of 6 working on data exploration, data pre-processing and building the prediction model.

## Conclusion
This project showcases how machine learning methods can be
applied to study and forecast employee attrition in a company.
Through tasks like preparing the data, turning words into
numbers, and creating a special prediction model called MLP
Back Propagation, we uncover significant factors affecting
employee attrition. We then offer advice to the company CEO
on preventing future employee turnover.
After examining our findings, we recommend the company to
implement the following strategies to prevent future employee
attrition:

1- Administer routine employee surveys to gauge job
satisfaction and pinpoint areas for enhancement.

2- Extend growth avenues to employees through initiatives
like training schemes and promotional opportunities.

3- Enhance managerial methods by offering consistent
feedback and guidance to staff members.

4- Ensure competitive salaries and benefits are provided to
retain employees.
